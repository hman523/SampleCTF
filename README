#SampleCTF

Here's a little CTF I designed to practice designing CTFs.
There are only a few puzzels but some are much harder than others.
In terms of difficulty, the order goes hiddenmessage, cypher, crazylist, encrypt, then otherhidden with hiddenmessage being the easiest.

Have fun and good luck!
